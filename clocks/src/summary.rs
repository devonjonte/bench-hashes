//! The one way every measurement summarises and compares its samples, in
//! BLAKE3-Servil, bench-hashes, and every probe.
//!
//! **A run's cost** for a cell is its mean: the total timed nanoseconds of
//! its samples over the total work they did, every sample counted
//! ([`mean`]). That is what a caller pays on average, and it moves
//! continuously when a cell spends more or less of its time at a slower
//! speed; a slow sample among few moves it in full, which is what the
//! caller met.
//!
//! **Comparing two programs** takes pairs of runs, one of each, back to back
//! and in alternating order, so that drift between the runs falls on both
//! sides alike. Each pair gives one ratio per cell, new mean over old. Most
//! of a measurement's uncertainty lies between runs (where the program's
//! code landed, where its threads were placed), which no figure from inside
//! one run can see; the pairs see it. A cell's change is the geometric mean
//! of its pairs' ratios ([`geometric_mean_permille`]), and every cell of a
//! comparison is judged at once ([`discoveries`]): a paired t-test on the
//! log ratios, the false discovery rate controlled over all the cells, and
//! a margin. Callers print the ratio each [`Judgment`] carries: the figure
//! judged.
//!
//! **Before changing these rules**, read bench-hashes' `METHODOLOGY.md`,
//! "Each part of the rule, and its evidence": each choice's evidence and
//! what it gives up.
//!
//! **Values** are nanoseconds per unit in fixed point, 64 integer and 64
//! fractional bits (Q64.64, as bench-hashes' `Fixed`); ratios in permille;
//! integers throughout, rounded once where a person reads them.
