"""Build b3sum contenders for `bench-hashes b3sum` into DIR, each named for what it is:
    python3 tools/b3sum-contenders.py FORK DIR [COMMIT...]
FORK is a checkout of github.com/johnservil/BLAKE3.
  DIR/b3sum-official-1.8.2  official BLAKE3's b3sum from crates.io (also as
                            official-1-thread, the same build with
                            --num-threads 1)
  DIR/b3sum-COMMIT          the fork's b3sum at each COMMIT (default: FORK's HEAD),
                            built from a clean worktree of that commit as its
                            README recommends: statically linked on Linux;
                            named b3sum where one COMMIT is given (with
                            b3sum-1-thread, the same build with --num-threads 1:
                            the names the README's chart reads), b3sum-COMMIT
                            where several are
  sha256sum, sha1sum, md5sum  the system's own, where installed: the programs
                            a user chooses between
Each b3sum is built as its own project recommends (official's from crates.io,
as `cargo install b3sum` builds it); on Linux, the fork's static link alone
makes each of its runs about 240 us shorter (METHODOLOGY, b3sum).
With LAYOUTS=N (default 1), each b3sum is also relinked N times, its functions
in a random order each time (lld's --symbol-ordering-file, as the fork's check
relinks the library), DIR/...-L0 to -L(N-1): a binary's layout alone moves its
times by several percent, so a program's cells should not rest on one layout's
luck. Layout i's seed is the build's name's checksum plus i: each build's
layouts are its own (two builds never share a seed, as check gives each side
its own), and the same on every invocation, so a layout built before is the one
asked for. bench-hashes b3sum runs a contender named more than once one build a
round.
Prints the contenders for bench-hashes b3sum, one NAME=COMMAND a line, official
first; pass each line as one argument (a command may hold flags):
    python3 tools/b3sum-contenders.py FORK DIR | tr '\\n' '\\0' | xargs -0 cargo run --release -- b3sum --files FILES
