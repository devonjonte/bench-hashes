//! `bench-hashes check --fork DIR [--against REV] [--new REV] [--old-bench REV] [--points POINTS | --probe POINTS | --cells all] [--layouts N] [--keep DIR] [--when-quiet]`:
//! did a change to BLAKE3-Servil hurt its speed in the cells its author names?
//! Run from a checkout of bench-hashes, it compares BLAKE3-Servil's working
//! tree (or `--new REV`) with a commit (`--against`, HEAD by default) and
//! prints the cells judged slower or faster, with their ratios; exit 0 when
//! no named cell is slower, 1 when one is, 2 when no scope was named or a
//! run's load left no verdict.
//!
//! What a check does, every time, with nothing to choose:
//! 0. Builds bench-hashes against both sides in turn from one path and
//!    compares the two builds (src/samecode.rs): where they hold the same
//!    code, the commits and the panic locations' line numbers aside, the
//!    verdict is "same code", exit 0, and nothing is measured (bench-hashes
//!    #125). Otherwise it names the functions that differ and goes on.
//! 1. Builds bench-hashes twice, against BLAKE3-Servil at each side (a commit
//!    of the working tree as `git add -A` would stage it, and the commit
//!    checked against), in worktrees of its own under `target/check/`, and
//!    relinks each side once per pair with its functions in a fresh random
//!    order: a binary's layout alone moves cells several percent (x86: 8-10%),
//!    the same for every run of that binary, so no sampling of one binary
//!    sees it; two sides with different layouts each pair do, and their
//!    seeds stay apart so identical code still meets a new layout in every run.
//! 2. Takes its scope from its caller. The check first prints a short
//!    summary of the diff (its files, its added and deleted lines, and the
//!    items its hunks sit in). Its author reads that summary, thinks through
//!    which cells the change can move, and names them with `--points`, in
//!    the labels `--points` takes ("2 KiB,idle 2 KiB,brief idle 3 KiB").
//!    `--probe POINTS` names the same scope for a three-pair survey with no
//!    verdict, before the change is built. `--cells all` measures every
//!    point, for a release or a change whose author judges it can act
//!    anywhere. With no scope named, the check prints the summary and
//!    stops before any build: choosing cells is the author's judgment, and
//!    the check carries no second guess at it. It prints how many points
//!    it measured and how many it left unmeasured, so the choice stays in
//!    the record.
//! 3. Runs `bench-hashes regress` over the pairs (LAYOUTS new links a side,
//!    each run FIRST_RUNS times): servil st and servil mt
//!    (the code that changes) at the regression check's visits
//!    (TO_CHECK_FOR_REGRESSIONS), judged all at once (clocks::summary).
//! 4. When no cell is slower, runs the cells `regress` names as suspects
//!    (level, the pairs' mean beyond the margin; at most 8) again on
//!    SECOND_PAIRS fresh pairs (SECOND_LAYOUTS new links a side, each run
//!    SECOND_RUNS times), judged among
//!    themselves: judged among every cell, a slowdown at one point is
//!    level unless it is many times its pairs' spread (bench-hashes #66).
//!
//! A change to BLAKE3-Servil's API changes the bench with it, so one bench builds
//! against one side alone: `--old-bench REV` builds the old side with this
//! bench at REV (a commit of this bench's repository, in a worktree under
//! `target/check/`; a bench that builds beside BLAKE3-Servil, so 1f4dfd63 or
//! later), the new side with the bench as it is. The cells are
//! keyed by use case and point, not by call, so the two sides' cells meet.
//!
//! It replaces BLAKE3-Servil's `tools/perf_regress.py` (October 19, 2026,
//! Zooko: one tool that does everything a change needs, at no cost to the
//! one who made it) and `REGRESS_POINTS`, a fixed list of five cells that
//! was blind to the cells after a gap and to the stream, where BLAKE3-Servil
//! had regressed before.
