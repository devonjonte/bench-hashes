//! Other programs' load on the machine while this process measures,
//! recorded by every measurement in this crate, with nothing to call.
//!
//! **What it counts.** The OS counts the CPU time every CPU spent busy;
//! this process counts its own (every thread). Their difference over a
//! stretch of wall time is how many CPUs other programs kept busy, in
//! milli-CPUs (1000: one CPU busy throughout). On Linux the OS also
//! counts steal time, which a hypervisor took from a VM's CPUs for other
//! work on the host, load a guest sees no other way.
//!
//! **When it reads.** A reading costs system calls, which take far longer
//! than a short timed call, so it never happens inside a timed interval
//! or per call. Each measurement in this crate calls [`tick`] outside its
//! timed intervals, between batches and before each gap; a tick reads
//! the machine only once a window of [`WINDOW_NS`] has passed since the
//! last reading, and otherwise costs one wall-clock read and one atomic
//! load. Measured in the Linux VM (`reading_cost` below, September 30,
//! 2026): a reading 8.6 us, a tick between readings 18 ns. A program
//! that times with [`crate::now`] directly calls [`tick`] itself, between
//! samples.
//!
//! **Placing samples in windows.** Every [`crate::Batch`] records when it
//! started, as [`now_ns`] (nanoseconds since this process's first
//! measurement), on the same scale as each [`Window`]'s bounds.
//!
//! **Resolution.** Both OSes count machine CPU time in ticks of 10 ms per
//! CPU. A window's reading therefore carries an error of up to a tick per
//! CPU: at most 0.16 CPUs over a 1 s window on 16 CPUs, well under
//! [`BUSY_MILLI_CPUS`].
//!
//! A window whose other load or steal reaches [`BUSY_MILLI_CPUS`] is
//! busy: when one closes, this module says so on stderr, so every probe
//! and benchmark shows it with no code of its own; [`windows`] gives
//! every window for reports and samples files.
