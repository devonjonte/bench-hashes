//! The one place the servil fork and bench-hashes read clocks. Every
//! measurement reads two things through it (AGENTS.md, "Measuring"):
//!
//! - **Wall time**, what a caller waits for: the platform's hardware
//!   counter through `std::time::Instant` ([`now`], [`since_ns`]):
//!   `CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW` on Darwin, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on Linux,
//!   `QueryPerformanceCounter` on Windows. A counter read can only
//!   over-count, when the thread is interrupted, which a median absorbs.
//! - **The thread's counts per core kind** ([`Counts`]): cycles,
//!   instructions, and time on performance and efficiency cores, from
//!   Apple's `thread_selfcounts(THSC_TIME_CPI_PER_PERF_LEVEL)`, or optional
//!   Linux x86 hybrid `cpu_core`/`cpu_atom` perf PMU groups. Linux records
//!   user-space cycles/instructions and PMU running time (including kernel
//!   time while scheduled); their ratio estimates the clock on long batches.
//!   Counter-read overhead matters on short intervals. The split records
//!   the core kind. Unsupported PMUs/permissions/platforms return `None`.
//!   Counts and wall time stay unscaled.
//!
//! Thread CPU time (`CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID`) is left out: at 1 ms samples
//! it agrees with the counter and adds an accounting layer to reason about;
//! once suspected of inventing speed, it was cleared by experiment, and the
//! moving variable was the core's frequency, which only cycles show
//! (github.com/johnservil/measure-clocks3, CPU-TIME-CLOCKS-AND-FREQUENCY.md).
//!
//! Read wall time alone inside a timed interval and the counts outside it:
//! a counts read is a system call.
//!
//! **Other programs' load** ([`load`]): every measurement here also records
//! how many CPUs other programs kept busy, in windows of about a second,
//! read between samples; each [`Batch`] records when it started, so its
//! window is known, and a busy window is reported on stderr as it closes.
//!
//! **Resolution.** The wall clock steps in ticks of the platform's counter:
//! 24 MHz, 41.67 ns, on an Apple M4 Max (every Darwin wall clock and the
//! CPU-time clocks alike; `CLOCK_REALTIME` and `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` in whole
//! microseconds: measure-clocks3, results of December 7, 2025) and in the
//! Linux VM (`arch_timer` at 24 MHz). A reading is a whole number of
//! ticks. So an interval of a few ticks is measured in one of two ways:
//! as a batch of calls long enough that a tick is a small share of it
//! ([`measure`]), or, where every call must be timed alone (a call after
//! a gap), as the sum of many such readings, each starting at a phase
//! against the ticks that nothing correlates with the call
//! ([`measure_after_gaps_prepared`]): the sum's rounding averages out. A median or
//! a minimum of single short readings keeps the rounding; take neither.
